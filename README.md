# Analysis of Workplace Factors Impact on Mental Health: Insights from Employee Research

In this project, I delved into the fascinating realm of mental health in the tech workplace, using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. The dataset, sourced from a 2014 survey, provides insights into attitudes towards mental health and the frequency of mental health disorders among tech workers.

## Experiments Conducted

### Correlation Matrix Analysis
I started by exploring the relationships between various workplace factors and mental health outcomes using correlation matrix analysis. This helped uncover potential associations and dependencies within the dataset.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model
Next, I employed a Support Vector Machine model to predict mental health outcomes based on the available workplace data. This classification model enabled me to identify key factors contributing to mental health conditions among tech employees.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
To gain a deeper understanding of the underlying structure of the dataset, I utilized Principal Component Analysis. PCA helped me identify important patterns and reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving its essential information.

### Linear Regression
Additionally, I conducted linear regression analysis to examine the relationships between specific workplace factors and mental health outcomes. This regression approach allowed for the quantification of the impact of individual variables on mental well-being.

## Technologies Utilized

- **Pandas:** A versatile data manipulation library that facilitated seamless handling and exploration of my dataset.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** These visualization libraries empowered me to create visually appealing and informative plots, bringing my data to life and enhancing interpretability.
- **Scipy:** The scientific computing library played a crucial role in conducting statistical analyses, providing valuable insights into the underlying patterns and relationships.
- **Scikit-learn:** This machine learning library was instrumental in implementing and evaluating various models, contributing to the predictive aspects of my project and enabling robust analysis.
- **NumPy:** As a fundamental numerical computing library, NumPy facilitated efficient numerical operations and array manipulations, enhancing the efficiency of my analyses.

By leveraging these powerful technologies and conducting a comprehensive analysis, I gained valuable insights into the complex interplay between workplace factors and mental health outcomes among tech professionals.
